	<h1>The Destruction of the AWAUF Organization!</h1>
	
	<h2> More Whispers of the So-Called 'Freedom Fighters'.</h2>
	
	<P>July 31, 2117: This is a story about success. Today, AWAUF has officially surrendered to the UWF forces who surrounded the headquarters of the
		treacherous organization who killed many innocent citizens of the UWF. All of the leaders and all of the suspected traitors are due to be
		executed by the end of the week, and everybody who hid information of the evil organization has been thrown into prison. However, as soon
		as one evil is defeated, another arises. It is a great day for the people of UWF, and it will lead to many more great days to come, days 
		of community and equality. However, the Freedom Fighters have taken advantage of our citizens, brainwashing them through dangerous and illegal propaganda,
		and offering hope of a 'better' world where people will 'make their own future', despite statistics all showing the benefits of our currennt
		government. Unfortunatly, a hidden threat is much harder to deal with than an open one, as proved with AWAUF. Supporters of the crooked
		group make twisted claims that are clear treason. However, the government will fight back as best they can. Those who are believed to be
		supporting this new way of life will be imprisoned. It may seem harsh, but with a weakened army, the government has to step in to protect
		her people, and we have no doubt that he threat will eventually be destroyed. The government has, for the time being, restricted travel to 
		areas where this new belief seems to be popular, such as the Americas and Europe. Until the threat is officially vanquished, however, the government
		will have to keep strict laws in place to keep order within our great society. We know that the government has always done what is in our best
		interest, and I assure everybody that this is no different this time. However, we will update you as soon as we can on the 2F organization,
		and will make sure you know everything that is necessay. Until then, take care.</P>

	<p>Dr. Randall Pierson's New Tracking device.</p>
	
	<h1>Pushing Back Againt AWAUF.</h1>
	
	<h2>Whispers of a New Corrupt Organization.</h2>
	
		<P>July 2, 2117: This is a story about progress and whispers. Last night, scientists discovered the source of the rebellion, the radioactive sea turtles, and the 
		AWAUF organization. At 11:34 p.m., Dr. Randall Pierson used his new invention, the Pierson Tracker, to discover the headquarters of AWAUF: St. Lucia. The 
		leaders of the organization fled shortly before Pierson discovered their betrayal through tracking devices he had pinned the Sea Turtles with during
		the attack on Iceland last week. Despite losing the island to the treacherous rebels, we now understand the technology the rebels used to corrupt sea life to
		help promote their cause. The beginning started as The Province of St. Lucia began to rise in power due to the masses of hybrid energ found within their island.
		Channeling this hybrid energy, St. Lucia began improving technology at a rate that quickly led to it becoming more powerful than the UWF had ever suspected.
		Through using the hybrid energy, advanced radiation discoveries, and new knowledge of Carbon-14, St. Lucia learned how to mutate sea turtles and other life.
		Rapid mutation of the sea turtles led to the marine creatures being able to survive incredible amounts of radiation: nearly 10000 times the amount it would
		take to kill a human. Using these turtles to attack others, the small rebel group, AWAUF, to take the oppurtunity to threaten the lives of the public on their island, and quickly
		expand into the Caribbean. Eventually, they reached Oceania, and later, Southeast Asia. However, as the UWF has previously expressed, hybrid energy is incredibly
		dangerous if used incorrectly or carelessly. It only took a tiny miscalculation from the scientists to lead to a massive explosion on Nauru: the explosion that led to 
		the UWF finally discovering the AWAUF organization. Through bribes and executions, the leaders of St. Lucia and AWAUF managed to keep the government's eyes off the
		Caribbean islands. Knowing that they were only safe for so long, AWAUF quickly pushed into Australia to try and establish a solid base. They pushed into more
		islands in a desperate attempt to get more citizens and force them into the military. That's where we were, as of last night, but now, everything has changed
		again. The UWF quickly developed a way to stop the turtles by increasing radiation in the turtles to an even greater amount. That was the first thing
		we had found to push back against the rebels. Despite having a greatly weakened military, our sheer numbers will quickly win over the AWAUF organization.</P>
		
		<P>However, that is not all. There is word of another secret organization that has been recruiting followers with the promise of freedom, despite the fact that
		living as mildly as we can, not only helps the world, the government, and the spread of help to those who need it, but allows the government to protect
		its citizens from evils like AWAUF. However, very little is known about the group, which UWF has been referring to as "Freedom Fighters," and we will need
		the help of all the UWF citizens to protect communism, the way of living in peace with one another. We will give an update as soon as possible. Until then,
		take care.</P>

		<h1>Rebels' Power Slowly Expands to Encompass Oceania.</h1>
		
		<h2>Australia Under Control of Corrupt AWAUF.</h2>
	
	<p>	   June 14, 2117: This is a story about sea turtles and war. Earlier this month, our news network informed you all of the incredibly minor, unimportant 
		threat of radioactive sea turtles and the spread of capitalistic government on small island-districts in Oceania. However, the islands' people are no longer
		alone. The radioactive turtles continue to drive more people mad each day. Cuba, The Maldives, Madagascar, even the American province of Hawaii, and many more seem to have fallen prey to the mad thinking, but,
		perhaps surprisingly, that is not the worst news. Yesterday evening, the rebels convened, and now, are taking back Australia from UWF rule.
	</p>
	
	<p>     Due to where the majority of the Australian population dwells, it was quite simple for the rebels to take the country. Despite it being a massive
	landmass, the majority of Australia's population dwells in close proximity to the coastline. This made it simple for the rebels to invade after the radioactive
	turtles destroyed the minds of the province's inhabitants. Even though the island has an incredible military, the weakened soldiers could not defend against the 
	well-conditioned army of the 32 provinces that have descended into madness. The UWF has forced relocation at least 15 miles from the coast to keep our citizens away
	from the extremely dangerous radioactive waves that the sea turtles give off, leaving several large cities almost completelty abandoned. People from the provinces of
	Japan, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka are all being relocated, as are people from all other islands the government sees as endangered.</p>
	
	<P>		However, there is good news. The military leaders of the UWF have come up with a plan to defeat the rebels. The public are not permitted to know the
	details of the plan to protect it from getting out to AWAUF, but we can confirm that the relocation of the people who live on the coastline is likely the first step in
	the process. We will get back to you as soon as we know more. Join us tomorrow for more news about the superiority of Communist government, as well as the
	benefits of banning freedom of religion and freedom of press. Until then, take care.                                              </P>

		<h1>The Minor Threat of AWAUF and Sea Turtles.</h1>

		   June 6, 2117: This is an story about sea turtles and politics.
			Sea turtles have recently been found to radioactively destroy large towns and, on rare occasion,
	small provinces. Everyone of the leaders of the world government who previously resided on the small island of Nauru were recently wiped out by
	these sea turtles, after 
	dangerous radioactive waves were discovered in places that the creatures had laid their eggs. The public of the islands have gone mad, saying that the communist UWF (Unified World Federation) is a poison to freedom and happiness.
	In their ignorance, they
	have formed an organization by the name of Advanced Warfare Against Unprecedented Threats (AWAUT) to combat the extremely generous government. Members
	of the organization, who reside on other islands around Nauru, have begun to fall into a form of anarchy by going against the accepted world government,
	and making their own, smaller, federal governments, and even, in the case of Kiribati, local governments who keep rule of each of the small islands that
	make up the nation. Palau, another small island country, has taken matters even further by adding in a judicial system to their government: a group of
	democratically elected judges to review any new laws that legislators may try and set in place. Despite these actions being obvious treason against the 
	UWF, the military has yet to step in since there is no known ways to fight against the sea turtles. In fact, the top scientists of
	Nepal, Bolivia, and Serbia have all come out saying that the death of the sea turtles may benefit the rebels' cause by spreading the deadly radioactive rays
	throughout the entire world. However, I, as the propaganda manager of the UWF, assure that we will quickly find a way to defeat the rebels, as well as the
	AWAUT organization. Join us tomorrow, same time, same place, to recieve updated news on the incredible growth of the unindustrialized world due to the new
	communist UWF, and the resistance by the pathetic supporters of AWAUT. Until then, stay away from small islands or beaches where radioactive sea turtles
	may reside. Until then, take care.
